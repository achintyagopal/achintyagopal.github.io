## Welcome!

I am **Achintya Gopal** and like to explore concepts related to quatum physics, machine learning, and finance. I do lots of side projects exploring unsupervised methods, qutum simulators, and reimplementing novel papers. Check out some of my stuff on **[GitHub](https://www.github.com/achintyagopal)**

I am currently a software engineer at [**Bloomberg LP](https://www.bloomberg.com)**!
